# Capabilities

A thread's privilege to perform an action on a subject.

## Kernel writes granted capabilities to a protected TCB

The TCB includes a table of granted capabilities.

## Delegation is an action

Having the action to delegate, allows the holder to grant another thread the rights to perform some or all of the actions on some or all of the subject. Without this privilege, delegation is disallowed.

## Actions are subject-type specific

The actions that can be performed on a thread are different than the actions that can be performed on an address range.
